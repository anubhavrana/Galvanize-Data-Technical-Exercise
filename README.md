# Galvanize-Data-Technical-Exercise
Technical exercise for the Galvanize Data Science Bootcamp

q1.py:

Creating a text analyser that outputs total word count, number unique words, number of sentences, average sentence length, list of words used (with frequency of use) and most common 3 word phrases. 

It also is able to accept STDIN through the command line as well as files. 

Q3_Split_Testing:

Another exercise where conversions for different variations of form were analysed. The actual exercise can be found below:

"Question 3 (Split-Test-Analysis): Introduction As context, here's a 10,000-foot view of the Acme Corp product: A consumer posts a request for a service needed. Every request is in some category (e.g., Catering, Personal Training, Interior Design) and some location (e.g., New York, San Francisco).

We match the request up with appropriate service providers and send each of those providers an invite to quote on the request. Providers view the invite and some choose to send a quote to the consumer expressing interest.

For the following questions, please be as specific and thorough as possible in your answers, quantify your statements as much as you can, and explain your computations. Include code you used where appropriate. You're free to use any software you like; it's OK if we can't run the analysis ourselves. You're encouraged to be as technical as you like in your answers, they don't need to be accessible to general readers (though that's an important part of the actual job).

Split Test Analysis I've just concluded a test of our quote form. After receiving an invite, service providers come to the quote form to view the consumer request and choose whether or not to pay to send a quote. My goal was to determine if certain changes to the design of the form would cause more providers to send a quote after coming to the page.

Over the course of a week, I divided invites from about 3000 requests among four new variations of the quote form as well as the baseline form we've been using for the last year. Here are my results:

Baseline: 32 quotes out of 595 viewers
Variation 1: 30 quotes out of 599 viewers
Variation 2: 18 quotes out of 622 viewers
Variation 3: 51 quotes out of 606 viewers
Variation 4: 38 quotes out of 578 viewers

What's your interpretation of these results? What conclusions would you draw? What questions would you ask me about my goals and methodology? Do you have any thoughts on the experimental design? Please provide statistical justification for your conclusions and explain the choices you made in your analysis."
